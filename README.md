## Overview
This repository contains all the lab tasks, assignments, and the final project submitted for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. The report documents the learning process, coding practices, and implementations completed throughout the semester.

## Contents

### 1. Lab Tasks
- Weekly programming exercises covering fundamental OOP concepts.
- Includes topics such as:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors and Destructors
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation and Abstraction
  - File Handling in OOP

### 2. Assignments
- Structured programming problems assigned throughout the semester.
- Focuses on applying OOP principles to solve real-world problems.
- Topics include:
  - Object-Oriented Design Patterns
  - Operator Overloading
  - Exception Handling
  - Dynamic Memory Management

### 3. Final Project: **1v1 Chess Game** (In Progress)
- A comprehensive project developed in **C++** as the final submission for the OOP course.
- Features:
  - Turn-based gameplay with timing for each move
  - Sound effects on each move
  - Board visualization with color-coded moves
  - Automatic clearing of previous board state (using `system(cls)`) 
  - Additional features under development

### 4. Practice Questions
- Trying to strengthen my logic-building skills by practicing random questions
## How to Use
1. Open the respective folders for **Lab Tasks**, **Assignments**, **Project** and **Practice Questions**
2. Each folder contains code files.
3. Run the C++ programs using a suitable compiler (e.g., GCC, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).
